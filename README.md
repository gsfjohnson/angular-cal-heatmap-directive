#Cal Heatmap AngularJS Directive#

This is a fork of AngularJS directive https://github.com/hoeselm/angular-cal-heatmap-directive-async for cal-heatmap http://kamisama.github.io/cal-heatmap/. The original fork added async data change detection and update, whereas now I am updating it for use with newer versions of cal-heatmap (v3.5.x) as well as adding full support for the different options available in cal-heatmap.

Install with bower:
```
$ bower install https://github.com/jazzkr/angular-cal-heatmap-directive.git
```
